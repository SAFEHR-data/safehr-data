title: "Synthetic Data"

Synthetic data – fabricated data that is manufactured to mimic real health data – offers a compelling “third way” to improve access to health data whilst ensuring the robust protection of patient privacy. Synthetic data is artificially generated data designed to mimic real data, for a specific purpose. It does not contain data directly collected from real patients and hence does not contain personally identifiable information (PII).

Please see [SQL Synthetic Generator](synthetic/sqlsynthgen.md) for details of the implementation at UCLH using sqlsynthgen. And to learn more checkout this [Introduction to Synthetic Data](https://www.researchdata.scot/engage-and-learn/data-explainers/intro-to-synthetic-data/) from HDR-UK, and Research Data Scotland.
