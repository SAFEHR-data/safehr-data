We provide a dashboard to display a catalogue of available OMOP data. Users can explore OMOP concepts through summary statistics. They can then export their selected concepts of interest. At the moment, the interactive tool can only be accessed from within the UCLH network. Future versions, supported by reliable synthetic data, will be available externally too.

See the demo video below for a quick overview of the tool.
