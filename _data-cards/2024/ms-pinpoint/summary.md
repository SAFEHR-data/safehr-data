## MS-PINPOINT

[MS-PINPOINT](https://www.ms-pinpoint.com/) is a multi-centre project developing healthcare tools to aid in the treatment of patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Based at UCL, we develop tools for segmenting MS-typical lesions in brain and spinal cord MRI, as well as tools that use electronic health record data to model how individual patients will respond to the range of treatment options available.

To support these endeavours we use MRI and EHR data obtained as part of routine care. In this datacard we provide an overview of the structured data that we store, as free-text data is highly identifiable and cannot be shared in a way that guarantees patient privacy while retaining semblance of the original data.
