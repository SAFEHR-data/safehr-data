UCLH is working in partnership with UCL in a major initiative in which educators and students will have access to UCLH’s anonymised patient database to improve healthcare teaching and training.

UCLH’s transformation into a digital hospital via its fully integrated health record, Epic, affords a rich array of digital health information that can be used in the training and education of the emerging healthcare workforce. A new data sharing agreement between UCLH and UCL will enable educators to gain approval to use fully anonymised patient data for education programmes in healthcare and related disciplines. While current processes are in place to approve the use of this data for research, until now, no such process has been in place to enable the use of this data for education.

The agreement will mean that UCLH is leading the way in the NHS to ensure that its workforce is ready to lead the digital transformation of healthcare in the UK. Public and patient representatives are at the heart of this initiative, and robust processes are in place to safeguard patient data. Anonymisation will ensure that patient privacy is protected to the highest possible standard.
