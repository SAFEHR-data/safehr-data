UCLH and the SAFehr team have been invited to join the SPHERE-PPL Annual General Meeting. This full-day event will bring together experts in a range of fields from industry, academia, and government to discuss cutting-edge research and explore collaborative opportunities within health.

Meeting participants will:

- Network with policy specialists and data scientists to discuss issues through a common language
- Identify forecasting contests that the SPHERE-PPL Community will undertake, and contribute to the design and outcomes of these endeavours to maximise their impact.
- Prioritise the training and support provided by SPHERE-PPL to the community to expedite the development of analytical capabilities where they are most urgently required

This event and the subsequent forecasting contests have been generously funded by The Alan Turing Institute.
