- **Tina Chowdhury** who is a Reader in Regenerative Medicine at the Centre for Bioengineering, QMUL and is Chief Investigator of the clinical trial said: "Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death world-wide. Children born prematurely have higher rates of diseases and life-long disabilities. We are developing algorithms that link patient data on air pollution exposure to identify the women who are at greater risk of delivering preterm, according to their genetics, lifestyle and environmental situation. At the end of the clinical trial, we will know the timepoints at which pollution exposure has the greatest impact on the mother and baby.”
- **Anna David**, Professor and Consultant in obstetrics and maternal/fetal medicine at UCLH and the Director for the EGA Institute for Women’s Health at UCL said “research shows that there are significant inequalities in health between men and women, who are rich or poor and who live in urban or rural communities and are from different ethnicity. We need to educate young people on how their likelihood of starting a family and having healthy children is affected by air pollution, smoking, obesity, alcohol, diet and other life-style factors.”
