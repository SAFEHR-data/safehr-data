Congrats to Zella King and Craig Wood.

> New machine learning technology can use real-time A&E data to predict how many patients will need an emergency bed later that day and in which part of the hospital. The technology is being presented today (11 July 2023) at the inaugural Health and Care Analytics (HACA) conference. The tool was developed by a team of analysts and hospital staff at UCL and UCLH. It is now being used by operational staff at UCLH to forecast how many emergency beds will be needed within the next eight hours, and where - whether surgical, medical, haematology and oncology, or paediatric departments. Early tests suggest the tool is better at predicting bed demand than standard methods.
