The Data Access Process for Research (DAP-R) is an HRA-devolved internal UCLH approvals process, providing a streamlined approach for in-house research studies that fulfil certain criteria and enables UCLH to approve specific projects internally. Research not falling within the criteria will require the usual approvals process via the Health Research Authority. A SAFEHR Team member will help researchers define the required data items, explore what data are available within UCLH, and determine a suitable method of delivery.

Research proposals are reviewed fortnightly by the Research Data Access Committee (RDAC). Once ready, they are submitted for review to the Data Trust Committee (DTC), which convenes monthly.

The Data Trust Committee comprises patient representatives and UCLH staff. It provides transparency and ethical review for proposed research projects. If the DTC is satisfied, the JRO will then formally confirm Capacity & Capability, and the extraction and delivery of data can begin.

DAP-R Express is an expedited branch of DAP-R for more straightforward and standardised data access, extraction and delivery. Eligible research requests must fit within the standard DAP-R criteria, in addition to our fixed Express requirements.

To determine whether your research proposal is eligible for either the DAP-R or DAP-R Express process, refer to the criteria below. For more information, please click here and contact the team if you believe you are eligible.

## Fast track

Your study could qualify for fast-track processing through DAP-R Express if it meets these criteria:

* Our SAFEHR team must either extract the data or directly supervise the extraction to comply with our anonymisation protocols
* The research IP will be owned by UCL or UCLH
* The data will be held in a secure environment within UCL or UCLH
* The request is in line with our data specification guidelines
* Structured data exists in OMOP-CAT
* Up to approximately 1,000 records with imaging
* Up to approximately 10,000 records without imaging

We will review these requirements with you during our first meeting.
