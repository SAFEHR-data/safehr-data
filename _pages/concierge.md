After reviewing our [Data Access Process for Research (DAP-R)](/docs/dap-r) and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, please complete our [brief enquiry form](https://form.safehr-data.org/triage/) to begin the process of accessing anonymised research data. You'll find guidance, and a link to the full application form [here](/docs/dap-research).

This form should take no more than a few minutes of your time, and we will schedule a call to discuss next steps within one week.

If you have additional questions regarding DAP-R, you may contact us at [uclh.research-dataconcierge@nhs.net](mailto:uclh.research-dataconcierge@nhs.net).
