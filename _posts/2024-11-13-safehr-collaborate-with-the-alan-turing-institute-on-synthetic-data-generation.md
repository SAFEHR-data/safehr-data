The IEEE Computer Society publishes our report on [SQLSynthGen](https://sqlsynthgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) today. This was developed by a team led by [Dr May Yong](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/may-yong) at the Alan Turing Institute in collaboration with SAFehr.

The Editor-in-Chief writes, we
 
> ... introduce SQLSynthGen, a tool that tackles the dual challenges of
data fidelity and privacy. This innovative method for generating synthetic data ensures that datasets maintain the
statistical properties and utility of real-world data while incorporating differential privacy mechanisms to protect
sensitive information. Its significance lies in providing high-quality synthetic data for research and analysis
without compromising patient privacy, making it particularly valuable in the healthcare sector.
