By default, UCLH clinical data is provided for research in a format called the [OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/), also referred to as simply 'OMOP'.

OMOP-ES is our OMOP data **E**xtraction **P**ipeline. It allows a diverse range of data and systems to be mapped to OMOP in a controlled, governed manner â€“ with rules to anonymise and redact data so as to respect the privacy of patients.

OMOP-ES easily allows new types of data to be incorporated, enforces high quality mapping and portability to other EPIC sites.
